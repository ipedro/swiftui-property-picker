/**
`PropertyPickerKey` encapsulates the essentials of property management within a picker interface. Conforming to this protocol enables types to be used seamlessly in conjunction with ``PropertyPicker``.

## Conformance

To conform to `PropertyPickerKey`, a type must satisfy several requirements, which enable it to interact efficiently with SwiftUIâ€™s environment:

- **RawRepresentable**: Conformance to `RawRepresentable` with a `RawValue` of `String` allows each property key to be directly associated with a string value, facilitating easy storage and display.
- **CaseIterable**: This requirement ensures that all possible instances of the type can be listed, which is particularly useful for presenting options in a picker.

## Properties

- `title`: A static property providing a descriptive title for this property. A default value is provided.
- `defaultValue`: Also static, this property specifies the default selection for the property. It serves as a fallback and initial state when user interactions have not yet altered the current selection. By default the first case is selected.
 - `label`: The label that describes this property instance. If no label is defined, the `rawValue` used instead.
 - `value`: Each instance of a conforming type provides a specific value associated with the property key.

## Implementation Example

Here's a straightforward example of how one might implement `PropertyPickerKey` for a setting that manages text alignment within an application:

```swift
enum TextAlignmentKey: String, PropertyPickerKey {
    case left, center, right
}
```
 - Warning: The `allCases` array must contain at least one item, or a `fatalError()` will be thrown in runtime.

## Conclusion

`PropertyPickerKey` offers a robust foundation for handling selectable properties in SwiftUI. By adhering to this protocol, developers can ensure their property types are well-integrated within the SwiftUI framework, benefiting from both the type safety and the rich user interface capabilities it provides. Whether for simple settings or complex configuration screens, `PropertyPickerKey` paves the way for more organized and maintainable code.
